#How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
*My current confidence level with arrays is 7 out of 10. I found myself making multiple small mistakes like naming my file -.rd instead of -.rb, this forced me to start over which led me to my next mistake which was thinking I had already pushed my "initial commit" when in fact I had started over so the naming of my commits is currently incorrect. I plan on circling back to this exercise and starting fresh to complete but wanted to get this pushed up so I have something to show for my morning.*
#Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
*Learning, not so much as practicing. At this point I feel like I have the tools in place but need to spend lots of time practicing using them and working in the terminal and using Ruby in atom.*
#What questions do you have about Arrays?
*Based on some of the method I was seeing online it looks like array's can get pretty large and complicated, is there such a thing as an array being to complex? If an array using a majority of my atom screen would it make more sense to explore creating multiple, more specific arrays?*
